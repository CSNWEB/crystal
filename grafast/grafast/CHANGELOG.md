  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Default plan resolver will now
  use `$parent.get(fieldName)` if $parent has a get method, falling back to old
  `access()` behavior if not.

## 0.0.1-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- [`2389f47ec`](https://github.com/benjie/postgraphile-private/commit/2389f47ecf3b708f1085fdeb818eacaaeb257a2d)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Massive overhaul of planning,
  now up to 2x faster!

  - ðŸš¨ `metaKey` and `optimizeMetaKey` now default to `undefined` - if you need
    the `meta` object in your step class, be sure to set them (e.g.
    `this.metaKey = this.id`)
  - `RemapKeys` can optimize itself away if it doesn't really do anything
  - Simpler plan diagrams - non-polymorphic buckets no longer have "polymorphic
    paths"
  - `deduplicate()` will now no-longer receive the step itself as a peer

- [`e91ee201d`](https://github.com/benjie/postgraphile-private/commit/e91ee201d80d3b32e4e632b101f4c25362a1a05b)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Various optimizations of the
  Gra*fast* plan by converting things to constants where possible.

  - `Step.optimize()` is now passed a `meta` object if the step sets
    `optimizeMetaKey`; this object can store planning-only values and share
    across a step family.
  - `__InputStaticLeafStep` now optimizes down to a constant
  - `ListStep` where every entry in the list is a constant is now automatically
    replaced with a `ConstantStep` representing the final list
  - `ObjectStep` where all the values are `ConstantStep` is now replaced with a
    `ConstantStep`
  - `ConstantStep` can now deduplicate with other constant steps with the exact
    same value
  - `OperationPlan.optimizeStep()` now also re-deduplicates the step if it
    supports multiple optimizations
  - `ConstantStep` now has `toStringMeta` to represent the constant value in the
    plan diagram
  - When each step is processed (but not by deduplicate) we'll automatically try
    and deduplicate any new steps created

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - The order in which steps are
  added to the plan diagram has changed, resulting in more optimal rendering.

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Upgrade to the latest
  TypeScript/tslib

- [`d39a5d409`](https://github.com/benjie/postgraphile-private/commit/d39a5d409ffe1a5855740ecbff1ad11ec0bf6660)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Implement planning and
  execution timeouts; add the following to your preset (the second argument to
  `grafast()` or `execute()`):

  ```ts
  const preset = {
    grafast: {
      timeouts: {
        /** Planning timeout in ms */
        planning: 500,

        /** Execution timeout in ms */
        execution: 30_000,
      },
    },
  };

  [`3df3f1726`](https://github.com/benjie/postgraphile-private/commit/3df3f17269bb896cdee90ed8c4ab46fb821a1509)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - ðŸš¨ LoadOneStep/LoadManyStep and
  related helpers have been merged into `LoadStep` so that the underlying
  business logic can be shared.

  `loadOne`/`loadMany` are still used exactly as before, but some of the related
  types and helpers have been renamed and `loadOne` now results in the same step
  class as an item from a `loadMany` (`LoadedRecordStep`).

  References to `LoadOneStep` and `LoadManySingleRecordStep` both need to be
  replaced with `LoadedRecordStep`.

  References to `LoadManyStep` need to be replaced with `LoadStep`.

  `LoadOneOptions` and `LoadManyOptions` are now both `LoadOptions` (and types
  refer to the _item_ type).

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - `__TrackedObjectStep` is now
  `__TrackedValueStep`. `MapStep`/`map()` are now `RemapKeysStep`/`remapKeys()`.
  `ListTransform` now accepts `listStep` rather than `listPlan`.

  [`395b4a2dd`](https://github.com/benjie/postgraphile-private/commit/395b4a2dd24044bad25f5e411a7a7cfa43883eef)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - The Grafast step class
  'execute' and 'stream' methods now have a new additional first argument
  `count` which indicates how many results they must return. This means we don't
  need to rely on the `values[0].length` trick to determine how many results to
  return, and thus we can pass through an empty tuple to steps that have no
  dependencies.

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - ðŸš¨ **BREAKING CHANGE**

### Patch Changes

- [#223](https://github.com/benjie/postgraphile-private/pull/223)
  [`4c2b7d1ca`](https://github.com/benjie/postgraphile-private/commit/4c2b7d1ca1afbda1e47da22c346cc3b03d01b7f0)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - In addition to `GraphQLArgs`,
  `grafast` now accepts `resolvedPreset` and `requestContext`; if both of these
  are set then `grafast` will perform `hookArgs` for you, this makes running
  tests a lot less boiler-plate-y (you no longer need to
  `parse`/`validate`/`execute` - just `grafast`).

  issue in postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter).

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - ðŸš¨ Breaking changes around
  types and postgres configuration:

  - `GraphileBuild.GraphileResolverContext` renamed to `Grafast.Context`
  - `GraphileConfig.GraphQLRequestContext` renamed to `Grafast.RequestContext`
  - `Grafast.PgDatabaseAdaptorOptions` renaed to
    `GraphileConfig.PgDatabaseAdaptorOptions`
  - `@dataplan/pg/adaptors/node-postgres` is now `@dataplan/pg/adaptors/pg` due
    to the bizarre naming of PostgreSQL clients on npm - we've decided to use
    the module name as the unique identifier
  - `makePgConfigs`:
    - is now `makePgConfig` (singular) - so you'll need to wrap it in an array
      where you use it
    - no longer exported by `@dataplan/pg` (because it depended on `pg`) -
      instead each adaptor exposes this helper - so import from
      `@dataplan/pg/adaptors/node-postgres`
    - accepts an object parameter containing
      `{connectionString, schemas, superuserConnectionString}`, rather than
      multiple string parameters
  - `makeNodePostgresWithPgClient` -> `makePgAdaptorWithPgClient`
  - `postgraphile` CLI will now try and respect the adaptor stated in your
    preset when overriding connection arguments
  - Removed `Grafast.RequestContext.httpRequest` and instead use
    `Grafast.RequestContext.node.req/res`; all server adaptors should implement
    this if appropriate
